# Final project of Introduction to Data Science

**Hengnan Hu**

The final part of this course is a group project. In this project, you can choose your own data set. We have seen a variety of data sources throughout the course. However, your data can come from anywhere. The data set should be sufficiently complex: For that, you are welcomed to check with [me](mailto:henry.hu@nus.edu.sg) to confirm that a data set you have found is interesting enough before submitting your proposal.

## Project teams

As a group project, you need to team-up with your classmates. Each team consists of 2-4 members. Practice pair/group programming! The assessment of the group project is based on the team and shared among the team member.

## Stages of the project

You will complete this project in three stages:

1. Stage 1: Proposal (2%), due date: 24th March 23:59
2. Stage 2: Presentation (6%), due date: 7th April 23:59
3. Stage 3: Peer evaluation (2%), due date: 14th April 23:59

The remainder of this document outlines the requirements and expectations for all stages of the project. You should read the entire document before getting started. The requirements and expectations for Stage 1 will only make sense in context of those for Stage 2.

## Data requirement

You will apply tools that you have learned in this course to a dataset of your choice.

(a) Simulated (artificially generated) datasets are not allowed

(b) You should NOT use a dataset used before in lectures/demo/labs/assignments/exams.

(c) You may NOT use the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

(d) You may NOT use CMU Statlib

## Stage 1: Proposal (2%)

### Content

Your proposal should contain the following:

1. **Data**: (5 points) Describe the data set you have chosen and where it comes from, and the numbers of observations and predictors in the dataset (to the best of your knowledge).
2. **Research questions**: (6 points) Come up with at least three research questions that you want to answer using these data. Make sure that at least two of these questions involve at least three variables. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Note that you will have the option to update / revise / change these questions for your presentation at the end of the semester.
3. **EDA**: (9 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses, but not necessarily fully answers, each of the three research questions you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualisations. Each Jupyter notebook output or plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation. Do not use more than 2 plots per research question.
4. **Timeline**: (2 points) Sketch out a timeline for the work you will do each week to complete this project. Be realistic.
5. **Teamwork**: (3 points) Describe in detail how you will divide up the work between team members and what aspects of the project you will complete together as a team. Note that during the presentation session each member needs to be able to answer questions about all aspects of the work, regardless of whether they took the lead on that section or not.

### Submission format

Your proposal should be written in Jupyter Notebook, so that all Python code, output, and plots will be automatically included in your write up. You should submit *both* the HTML file produced by Jupyter Notebook as well as the .ipynb file.

### Grading

Your proposal will be graded out of 25 points, as outlined above, and will contribute 2% towards your score of this course.

## Stage 2: Presentation (6%)

Use one of your research questions, or come up with a new one depending on feedback from the proposal, for Stage 2 of the project.
### Content
1. **Introduction:** Outline your main research question.
2. **EDA:** Do some exploratory data analysis to tell an interesting story about your data. Instead of limiting yourself to relationships between just two variables, broaden the scope of your analysis and employ creative approaches that evaluate relationships between more than two variables.
3. **Research question:** Use one of your research questions, or come up with a new one depending on feedback from the proposal. If applicable, perform a hypothesis test to answer your question. If you do, make sure to check any applicable assumptions. If you do not use a hypothesis test, use other means to show what answer the data provide.
4. **Prediction:** Predict or classify one variable in your dataset from other variables. Motivate why you choose the outcome and its predictors. Evaluate the performance of your predictive model or the resulting classifier using appropriate metrics and visualisations. Remark: While the other parts of your presentation should nicely fit together as one whole, this prediction part might not fit as nicely, depending on your research question or data narrative. That is okay.
5. **Conclusion:** A brief summary of your findings from the previous sections without repeating your statements from earlier as well as a discussion of what you have learned about the data and your research question(s). You should also discuss any shortcomings of your current study, either due to data collection or methodology, and include ideas for possible future research.

### Presentation format & length

You will give a presentation of between 7 and 10 minutes of your work to the rest of the class. Each team member must speak during this presentation. The 10 minute time limit is firm: You will be asked to stop at the end of the 10 minutes. Therefore, you must decide carefully what you will highlight during your presentation and practice to make sure you can fit everything you want to say in the time limit.

**Slides:** If you use slides, please submit them in PDF format.

**Jupyter Notebook:** All code used to generate the statistics and plots in your slides should be organised and submitted in a Jupyter Notebook document and its HTML output, that is 2 files.

Each presentation will be followed by a couple of minutes of questions from the audience, including the instructor.

### Grading

Your presentation and accompanying files will be graded out of 75 points, and will contribute 6% towards your score of this course.

Grading of the project will take into account:

- Correctness: Are the procedures and explanations correct?
- Presentation: What was the quality of the presentation, data narrative and the slides?
- Content and critical thought: Did your think carefully about the problem?
- Tidiness: Is your code organised well?

Your team scores will be based on the following components:

- 45 points - presentation
- 20 points - code
- 10 points - Q&A

## Stage 3: Peer evaluation (2%)

Each student is asked to fill out the peer evaluation form on Canvas that assesses individualâ€™s contribution to the group. This peer evaluation will contribute 2% towards your score of this course.

**Submission (for Stage 1 and Stage 2)**

Only one submission per team is required.

1. Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb)
2. HTML output (.html)
3. For stage 2, if slides are used, the PDF of the slides
